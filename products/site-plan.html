        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Our purpose is to provide the customer service representatives with WISE Home Solutions a space where they can find detailed information on the company products. They will be able to see pictures of the equipment as well as a few key details on each product including the current price point.
        The site itself will be broken down into different sections or pages to allow easier searchability and will include at minimum a page on security products and then another page on home automation products.      
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Security Products</h3>
      <p>
        A breakdown of products that will be offered on the security page include the following. There will be two panel types consisting of a GC2 and a GC3 panel. It might be a good idea to address the cell chip that is needed as well for each of these systems. In addition to the panels, there will be window or door sensors, commonly referred to in the industry as a DW10. There will also be glass breaks and motion sensors. The site should include details on when it is appropriate and when it is not appropriate to use each of these products.  Some of the other options that will be available include a smoke detector or fire fighter. These are the common products offered and the DW10 will be listed at $40 each and the glass break, motion, smoke detector, and fire fighter will all be listed at $70 each. The cell ship will be listed at $150 and the GC2 panel will be $300 while the GC3 panel will be $510.
        Additional content may include how to register a cell unit and onboard a system and the details on the following third-party companies that are part of the process. These could include AvantGuard who is responsible to monitor the system and Alarm.com where a customer can access their system through a mobile application. The cell chips are registered or assigned to a specific panel where an address is designated so that whenever a call comes in from that specific chip the monitoring station knows the location of that panel.

      </ul>
      <h3>Automation Products</h3>
      <p>
        Home automation will include garage door modules and the difference between providing the module and if the garage door has a built-in module. The garage door module will be listed at a cost of $70 while the built in one we can tie into the system at no additional cost to the customer. There are three colors to choose from if a customer is interested in a smart door lock. The lock itself can be purchased as a doorknob or a lever and the colors are venetian bronze, nickel, and brass. Either option and any color would still be the same cost of $160. Next, there are multiple options for a thermostat which include the 2GIG brand, the alarm.com brand, and the Google Nest brand. The price on the 2GIG and alarm.com thermostats is $100 while the Nest branded thermostats are $250. All allow the customer to control the temperature in their home remotely and help to conserve energy.
        Finally, there are multiple options when it comes to Ring products. The most common product requested is the doorbell camera which is $120. It typically will be wired using the existing doorbell wiring however it can be placed anywhere as it includes a rechargeable battery. The stick-up camera is also $120 and includes a built-in rechargeable battery as well. The most expensive camera is a spotlight camera, and these will cost $210. This camera also includes a rechargeable battery however all cameras are compatible with the solar panel which makes it so there is no need to pull out the battery ever so often to charge it.
