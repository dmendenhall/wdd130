    <h2>David Mendenhall</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I currently live in Riverton, UT with my amazing wife, Kim, and our five children. 
        Most of my nights/weekends consist of either driving one of our kids somewhere or waiting for one of them to be done with whatever it was that I drove them to. 
        It's a lot of baseball and soccer, jazz and ballet, piano and musicals, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.</p>        
    <p>I have been a life long learner, in one capacity or another. However, I have yet to finish my bachelors degree which is my goal this time around. 
        I started going to school thinking I would enjoy a degree in accounting, that ended up not being for me. 
        Then I thought I would pursue a degree in business, turned out that wasn't right either. 
        This time around, I am majoring in Applied Technology and will graduate in 2024!</p>
    <p>I enjoy sports, music, theater, hiking, movies, and board games. 
        Those who know me well might say that board games are my 'problem' as I currently am 2 games shy of owning 500 in my collection. 
        The best part though, is that they get played frequently with family and friends.
        If anyone is local and wants to get together, let me know and we'll make it happen.</p>
    <p>Finally, I love my Savior and I'm so grateful for his gospel and the peace and comfort it provides me in this life.</p>
    <p>I can't wait to get to know more of you and if there is anything I can do for any of you, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
